# IMP (Image Restoration Project) Configuration File
# This file contains all configuration options for the image restoration pipeline

# Model configurations
models:
  # Denoising module settings
  denoising:
    # Type of denoising algorithm to use
    # Options: "opencv" (fast, CPU-based) or "nafnet" (high quality, GPU-based)
    type: "opencv"
    
    # Denoising strength parameter (1-100)
    # Higher values = more aggressive denoising but may lose details
    # Recommended: 10 for light noise, 20-30 for heavy noise
    strength: 10
    
    # Skip denoising step entirely
    skip: false
  
  # Super-resolution module settings
  super_resolution:
    # Type of super-resolution model
    # Currently only "realesrgan" is supported
    type: "realesrgan"
    
    # Upscaling factor
    # Options: 2 (2x upscale) or 4 (4x upscale)
    scale: 4
    
    # Tile size for processing large images (in pixels)
    # Larger tiles = faster but more memory usage
    # Recommended: 512 for 4GB GPU, 1024 for 8GB+ GPU
    tile_size: 512
    
    # Overlap between tiles (in pixels)
    # Larger overlap = smoother blending but slower processing
    # Recommended: 10-15% of tile_size
    tile_overlap: 64
    
    # Use FP16 (half precision) for inference
    # Reduces memory usage by ~50% with minimal quality loss
    # Recommended: true for GPUs with limited memory
    use_fp16: true
    
    # URL to download pre-trained weights
    # Multiple mirrors can be added in code for fallback
    weights_url: "https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.2.5.0/realesrgan-x4plus.pth"
    
    # Skip super-resolution step entirely
    skip: false

# Processing pipeline settings
processing:
  # Maximum image dimension (width or height) before automatic resizing
  # Images larger than this will be resized during preprocessing
  # Recommended: 2048 for most cases, 4096 for high-end GPUs
  max_image_size: 2048
  
  # Save intermediate results after each processing step
  # Useful for debugging but increases disk usage
  save_intermediate: false
  
  # Enable checkpoint system for resuming interrupted processing
  # Checkpoints allow resuming from the last completed step
  checkpoint_enabled: true
  
  # Directory to store checkpoint files
  # Relative or absolute path
  checkpoint_dir: "./checkpoints"

# Logging configuration
logging:
  # Log level
  # Options: "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
  # DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
  # INFO: General information about processing steps
  # WARNING: Warning messages for potential issues
  # ERROR: Error messages for failures
  level: "INFO"
  
  # Log file path
  # Logs will be written to both console and this file
  file: "imp.log"
